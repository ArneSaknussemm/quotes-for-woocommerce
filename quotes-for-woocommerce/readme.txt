This WordPress plugin extends the WooCommerce Plugin. It allows the site admin the ability to send quotes for products. All prices are hidden from the user on all pages until the admin sends a quote. No payments will be taken at Checkout.

Plugins required:
<ol>
<li>WooCommerce 3.0.0 or higher</li>
</ol>

Want to convert your WooCommerce store into a Quote only program? This plugin allows the admin to hide the prices on a per product basis and modify the Add to Cart button to 'Request Quote'.

No payment is taken at Checkout. The prices for the product can be setup in the WooCommerce->Orders page and once a quote is finalized, the plugin will send an email to the end user notifying the same.

The users can then make the payments using the link in the email or the My Accounts page.
